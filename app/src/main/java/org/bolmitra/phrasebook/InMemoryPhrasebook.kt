 * shipped inside a language pack, but FTS4 can only be exercised on a device, so this stands in
 * until then. Swapping it is a constructor change, not a rewrite — the lookup ladder itself
 * lives in [PhraseMatcher] and is already unit-tested.
 *
 * Note what this does NOT fake: normalisation, the ladder, provenance and slot fill are all the
 * real implementations. Only candidate retrieval is substituted — FTS4 would narrow the
 * candidate set for speed, and scanning a short list gives identical results.

 * Every `targetTextNative` / `targetTextDeva` value below is a transparent placeholder. §6.3
 * requires every shipped phrase to be **native-speaker verified** — that is what makes T0 safe
 * in front of children, and it is the reason T0 outranks every model in the design.
 *
 * Securing native-speaker reviewers is Phase 0 risk #1 and it is still open. Until it closes,
 * these strings exist only to exercise the ladder, and [DEMO_STRINGS_VERIFIED] gates a warning
 * banner in the UI so nobody mistakes this for content.
 *
 * Devanagari is nonetheless the correct target script: V7 confirms Mundari in Jharkhand is
 * written in Devanagari, which is why no transliteration sits on the critical path (§4.6).

     *
